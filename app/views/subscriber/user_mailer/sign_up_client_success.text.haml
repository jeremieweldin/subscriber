Thanks for joining rankedHiRe. We are committed to building a platform that makes finding and comparing staffing agency talent as easy as possible. We will continue to onboard more agencies, strengthen our candidate matching algorithm, and improve the user experience. The following best practices will help businesses successfully source candidates on our platform:

Be Specific – Know what you’re looking for. The more detailed you are in your search criteria, the better we can match you with your ideal candidates.

Request Multiple Introductions – Businesses who request 3+ candidate introductions have more success than those who only request one introduction.   

Be Conscious of Market Rates – Offering a competitive salary increases the available talent pool of candidates interested in your position. Advertise your compensation accordingly.

Post the Job –Let staffing firms work to fill your position without locking-in to the candidates they find. Browse and engage with only the ones you want.

Should we ever fail to meet your expectations, please let us know. Our support team is always available to answer any questions or issues that you might be having.
